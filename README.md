# classification-data-analysis
In this problem, you will apply different classification methods. You will use a Rock dataset where you will use 19 different rock features to predict the rock category. The data you need are included in these two files: 1) aggregateRockData.xlsx Download aggregateRockData.xlsxyou will only use 2nd column that contains the rock category number (1 = Igneous, 2 = Metamorphic, 3 = Sedimentary) - that will be the label. 2) norm540.txt  Download norm540.txtyou will only use columns 4 to 22 - those will be the attributes (features). See this website for a detailed description of the dataset: https://osf.io/cvwu9/wiki/Data%20File%20Descriptions/. Links to an external site.

IMPLEMENTED BELOW THINGS.

**PROJECT NAME: Data Analysis and Classification**

**1. Attribute Analysis:**
   - Displayed statistical values for each attribute.
   - Provided visualizations (histograms) of attribute distributions.
   - Identified attributes that might require special treatment and discussed potential treatments.

**2. Relationship Analysis:**
   - Computed Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) between data attributes.
   - Generated scatter plots to analyze relationships between attributes and labels.
   - Provided insights and observations on attribute relationships.

**3. Data Splitting:**
   - Selected 20% of the data for testing, 20% for validation, and used the remaining 60% for training.
   - Described the methodology for splitting and ensured representativeness of test and validation portions.

**4. Multinomial Logistic Regression:**
   - Explored hyperparameters C, solver, and max number of iterations.
   - Reported training, validation, and testing performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
   - Discussed the impact of hyperparameters on performance.

**5. Support Vector Machines:**
   - Explored hyperparameters C, kernel, degree of polynomial kernel, and gamma.
   - Reported training, validation, and testing performance metrics.
   - Discussed the impact of hyperparameters on performance.

**6. Random Forest Classifier:**
   - Explored hyperparameters including the number of trees, max depth, minimum samples for split, and minimum samples for leaf.
   - Analyzed feature importance.
   - Reported training, validation, and testing performance metrics.
   - Discussed the impact of hyperparameters on performance and feature importance.

**7. Ensemble Classifier:**
   - Combined classifiers into an ensemble.
   - Strived for performance above 80% accuracy on the validation set.
   - Tested the selected ensemble on the test set.
   - Described and discussed findings, highlighting the advantages of the ensemble approach.

This project demonstrated skills in data analysis, attribute exploration, classification model training, and ensemble modeling. The comprehensive approach ensures a thorough understanding of the dataset and effective utilization of machine learning techniques for classification tasks.
